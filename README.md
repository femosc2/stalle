## FAQ

### GIT Etiquette

all commits must be structured like the following ```<task>(<project>): <description of what you've done>```

task = chore, feat, fix, ci, tes, documentation

project = client or server

### Workspaces

This repo uses workspaces! This means that you can run all commands directly from the root of the repo like this

```npm install --workspace client```
```npm run dev --workspace server```
